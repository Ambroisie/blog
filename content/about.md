I'm currently working as a backend engineer at [DGEX
Solutions](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dgex-solutions/), an offshoot of
[SNCF RÃ©seau](https://www.sncf-reseau.com/), the French national railway entity.

You can find my CV [here](https://cv.belanyi.fr/en.pdf). Or

If you are a friend or family, you might be looking for my [wish
